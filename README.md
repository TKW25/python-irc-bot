# python-irc-bot
First project on Github

Anm IRC bot coded in Python, originally just one big file I decided to split it apart and rewrite it. 
Currently it has just a handful of the core features, it can connect to channels,
read text, and send messages.  Additionally it can take reminders and send them to the designated nick as well as alert userse
when a designated nick has come online.  

Other features forth coming in no particular order:
-Chat logging
-Ability to send and receive files over XDCC 
-Ability to manage channel topics for channels that desire persistent channel topic format
-etc
